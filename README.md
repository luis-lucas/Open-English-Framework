## About The Project

This repository contains the front-end code for a landing page for "Free English Path," an innovative ESL learning platform. The page is designed to convey the core philosophy of learning English naturally, mirroring how children acquire their first language â€“ through immersion, meaningful context, and communicative practice.

The primary goal of this landing page is to clearly communicate the program's unique methodology, highlight its 100% free nature, and emphasize its structured approach to building fluency and confidence in English. It features a dynamic visual experience to captivate the target audience and their guardians.
